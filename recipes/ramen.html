    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>If you have ever wanted to make Japanese noodle house ramen, this tonkatsu recipe is for you.<br>
        This everyday meal is great for singles with some cooking experience; it may take longer than the overall time without cooking experience.<br>
        To save time, I rarely measure each ingredient's amount due to the large number of small measurements in the recipe.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons spicy sesame oil</li>
        <li>2 (1x3-inch) boneless pork chop slices</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon black sesame seeds, divided</li>
        <li>2 leaves fresh basil, chopped, divided</li>
        <li>1 leaf fresh sage, chopped, divided</li>
        <li>1 (3 ounce) package instant ramen noodles (such as Shirakiku®), seasoning packet discarded</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons shredded dried kombu</li>
        <li>1 ¾ tablespoons bonito soup stock (such as Hondashi®)</li>
        <li>1 ¾ tablespoons soy sauce (shoyu)</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon white miso paste with dashi</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Toppings:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 1/3-inch slices fish paste stick (naruto)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon tonkatsu sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sushi ginger (shoga), finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 green onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a small pot halfway with water. Bring to a boil; add egg and cook in boiling water for 15 minutes. Drain. Run cold water over egg and set aside to cool.</li><br>
        <li>Pour sesame oil into a large skillet. <br> Lay pork slices in oil. Cover pork with 1 tablespoon olive oil, 1/2 tablespoon sesame seeds, 1/2 of the basil, and 1/2 of the sage. <br> Flip and cover pork with these remaining ingredients: 1 tablespoon olive oil, 1/2 tablespoon sesame seeds, basil, and sage.</li><br>
        <li>Cook pork, covered, over medium-low heat, until evenly browned on the bottom, about 5 minutes. <br> Flip and continue cooking until second side is browned, about 5 minutes more. Remove from heat.</li><br>
        <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. <br> Cook ramen noodles in boiling water until tender, about 3 minutes. Drain in a colander set in the sink; rinse noodles until water runs clear. <br> Return noodles to the pot.</li><br>
        <li>Stir kombu, bonito stock, soy sauce, and miso paste into noodles. <br> Cook, stirring with chopsticks, over medium heat, until miso paste is dissolved, 3 to 5 minutes. <br> Transfer noodles to a serving bowl.</li><br>
        <li>Peel and cut egg in half lengthwise. Place egg, pork slices, and fish paste slices over noodles. <br> Garnish with tonkatsu sauce, ginger, green onion, and black pepper.</li>
    </ol>
